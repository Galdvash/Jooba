# React Native & Node.js Project with MongoDB

This project is a mobile application built using React Native for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. The application connects to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve data, and it uses CORS to handle cross-origin requests. Additionally, the app features a dark mode and integrates real-time news and data graphs.

## Features

- **Frontend**: Developed with React Native, featuring dynamic data display and a dark mode option for enhanced user experience.
- **Backend**: Developed with Node.js and Express, serving API endpoints for data retrieval and storage. \`nodemon\` is used for automatic server restarts during development.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used to store data, including titles, descriptions, and images.
- **Real-Time News**: Fetches live news articles using the \`https://newsdata.io\` API.
- **Real-Time Data Graphs**: Displays real-time data graphs using Yahoo Finance data, without requiring an API key.
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is enabled to allow communication between the React Native app and the backend server.
- **Testing**: API endpoints were tested using Postman to ensure correct functionality.
- **ES Modules**: The project is configured to use ES modules (\`import/export\`) instead of CommonJS (\`require/module.exports\`) by setting \`type: "module"\` in \`package.json\`.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Yarn (Package Manager)
- MongoDB

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
\`\`\`

### 2. Install backend dependencies:

Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary packages using Yarn:

\`\`\`bash
cd backend/my-back-app
yarn install
\`\`\`

### 3. Install frontend dependencies:

Navigate to the React Native project directory and install the necessary packages:

\`\`\`bash
cd ../../client
yarn install
\`\`\`

### 4. Install additional React Native libraries:

Ensure you have installed the necessary libraries for React Native:

\`\`\`bash
yarn add react-native-svg
\`\`\`

## Usage

### 1. Run MongoDB:

Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine. By default, the application connects to a MongoDB instance running locally on port 27017.

### 2. Start the backend server:

Navigate to the backend directory and start the server:

\`\`\`bash
cd backend/my-back-app
yarn start
\`\`\`

The server will start on \`http://localhost:8989\`.

### 3. Start the React Native app:

Navigate to the React Native project directory and start the app:

\`\`\`bash
cd ../../client
yarn start
\`\`\`

### 4. Access the application:

- **React Native App**: Follow the prompts to run the app on your Android or iOS device/emulator.
- **Backend Server**: Test the API using Postman or directly within the app.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

- **GET** \`/api/items\`: Retrieve all items from the database.
- **POST** \`/api/items\`: Add a new item to the database. The request body should include \`title\`, \`description\`, and \`image\`.

Example POST request body:

\`\`\`json
{
"title": "Sample Item",
"description": "This is a sample item.",
"image": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
}
\`\`\`

## Application Overview

This application provides a platform to display real-time news and data visualizations. The key features include:

- **Real-Time News**: The app fetches news articles using the \`https://newsdata.io\` API, displaying the latest updates on various topics directly in the app.
- **Real-Time Data Graphs**: Utilizing data from Yahoo Finance, the app displays real-time financial graphs. The integration does not require an API key, making it easy to implement.
- **Dark Mode**: Users can switch between light and dark modes to enhance the viewing experience, especially in low-light conditions.

### Dark Mode

The application includes a dark mode feature that adjusts the UI to be easier on the eyes in low-light environments. This feature can be toggled within the app settings.

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS Issues**: Ensure that the \`cors\` package is installed and configured correctly in the backend to allow cross-origin requests.
- **MongoDB Connection**: If MongoDB is not running or the connection string is incorrect, the backend server may fail to connect to the database.
